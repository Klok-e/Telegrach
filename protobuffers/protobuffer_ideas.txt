The main idea is that every single command has its unique code, that server and client can understand.

For example:
	If client sends command 0 to server then server can interpret it as client creation command. 
	Then server creates the client`s data and send it to the actual client.
	Codename for this, for example, is 1. And server sends login and password. Encoded of cource.
	And so on.
	So, protobuffers must declare the structure of message for each code.

	What if we are sending a list of messages, for example?
	Than we can separate each message by separator. For example \n\n. Or more complex. Food for thought.

	The expected structure of enterchanging message:
		CODE=0\nPARAM=2\n\nencoded_byte_interpretation_of_message1\nencodedbyte_interpretation_of_message2\nencodedbyte_interpretation_of_message3\n\n\n\n
